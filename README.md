# Project CVA (Code Vulnerability Analysis)

## Description

The **CVA** (Code Vulnerability Analysis) project is designed to help developers identify vulnerabilities and errors in their source code. Users can upload their code, and the system will perform an analysis to detect potential security issues. 

The project aims to generate comprehensive reports that highlight:

- **Vulnerability Locations**: Specific lines or sections of code where vulnerabilities are detected.
- **Recommendations for Fixes**: Suggested improvements or corrections to enhance code security.
- **Comments**: Explanations and best practices related to the identified issues.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project strives to provide accurate and actionable insights for improving code quality and security.

## Status

This project is currently in development.
